# Eye-Blinks-Based-Authentication-System

Authentication plays a major role in maintaining security in data accessing. It is the
process of recognizing a user’s identity and providing data access. It is a mechanism of associating 
an incoming request with a set of identifying credentials and providing access to data.
Traditional password authentication could not provide enough security. Even though many 
other authentication methods were introduced but unfortunately they couldn’t prevent all types of 
security breaches, because of traces like finger prints, touch marks etc., were left during 
authentication.
Hence we come up with an idea named “Double Authentication System Integrating Face 
Recognition and Eye Blink Count Recognition”. This system provides double layered 
authentication for a user, that makes authentication more secure. The two layers of authentication 
are face recognition followed by eye blink count recognition. This system first verifies the user’s 
face and then takes the eye blink count from the user and validate the credentials and provides an 
opening wedge for accessing data if the input credentials are valid.
